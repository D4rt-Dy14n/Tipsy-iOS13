# Tipsy-iOS13
App for tip calculation

I arranged all constraints by myself, including for small screen sizes (SE). Also, improved the app by adding landscape mode and constraints.

Solved a problem with dot appearing on decimal keyboard instead of comma. Made comma substitution instead of dot for counting Double value.

This is the app I made learning iOS 13 & Swift 5 course by Angela Yu (https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp).
